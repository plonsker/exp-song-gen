##Experimental song generator

This repo is dedicated to a single method that will print out notes that will be turned into riffs for experimental rock songs. The most "out there" riffs will be made into an EP. The project will be named C, after the computer language and for the first note that the array in the method begins with. Riffs that are very similar to each other will be 'stitched' together to form one song.
